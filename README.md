# Lambda: The World's First Open-Source Social Media App

**NOTE:** _Lambda will be released on 10 Nov 2023_

Welcome to Lambda, the world's first open-source social media app. Created by Ezpie, Lambda is a revolutionary platform that brings the power of social media into the hands of the open-source community.

## Overview

Lambda is designed with simplicity in mind, providing a user-friendly interface that makes navigation a breeze. Despite its simplicity, Lambda offers all the features you'd expect from a top-tier social media platform.

## Open-Source

What sets Lambda apart is its open-source nature. This means that anyone can contribute to the development and improvement of the app. It's a social media platform built by the people, for the people.

## Community

Lambda is fully maintained by a dedicated team of maintainers who are always ready to help out. Whether you're a user encountering an issue or a developer looking to contribute, our maintainers are just a message away.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you're a seasoned open-source veteran or a newcomer looking to make your first contribution, there's a place for you in the Lambda community.

### Getting Started

To get started you can follow these instructions:

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. If you have an issue, first file it and wait for us to decide weather or not this should be assigned to a contributor or a maintainer
3. If you get lucky this may get assigned to you, now all you have to do is try to find a fix and make a PR for that.

To make your PRs accepted, please make sure you provide a full detailed explanation of what all changes you have done
